## Main goal of the projet was to improve the web interface for the student in semester 1 and give to the teacher a plateform to follow his class more efficiently.

This project was the occasion for us to learn and practice PHP/MYSQL and deepen our knowledge in HTML and CSS.

### We used the following technology : 

- PHP - MYSQL - HTML - CSS - JavaScript
- We followed the application design pater "MVC" (Model - View - Controller) to structure our files and directories.
